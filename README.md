# How to create a good Bug Report?
If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed. So fixing a bug depends on how effectively it's reported.

## 1) Reproducible:
If your bug is not reproducible it will never get fixed. You should clearly provide the steps to reproduce the bug. Do not assume or skip any reproducing step. A Step-by-step description of the issue is easy to reproduce and fix.

## 2) Be Specific:
Do not write a essay about the problem. Be Specific and to the point. Try to summarize the problem in minimum words yet in effective way. Do not combine multiple problems even they seem to be similar. Write different reports for each problem.

## 3) Environment Details:
Include the version of ATCTrainer you are using and if relevent the airport or traffic file

## 4) Follow Up:
Even the most well written bug reports may need follow up to truly diagnose the cause of the bug. Once you have submitted a bug report, please monitor your email and check back periodically to provide extra information that is requested.
